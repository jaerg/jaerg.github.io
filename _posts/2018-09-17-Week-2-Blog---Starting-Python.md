  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>A lot about programming and coding is perseverance. When you come across an error in your code you need to keep trying, and trying, and try until you finally fix the problem.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>When I was programming, every now and then I would come up against a problem that I had to tried to solve multiple times but failed, and this is when you should ask a teacher or another student for help. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>In the lesson we were all coding independently and by ourselves, so it was just us doing our own work rather than someone else doing all the work for us as that will not help us learn at all. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>After the lesson I reflected on how I could have achieved more in the lesson and what i could have done better. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>When Mr Burn was talking to us at the beginning of the lesson about his expectations I had to be fully engaged so I could understand everything he was saying. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think to Improve my learning I think I could have tried to work faster and more efficiently on Code Academy without being distracted by others around me. </td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, to improve my learning, I will try to get more done on Code Academy in the lesson and I will try not to get distracted by others around me as much. </td>
